# Eye-of-the-tiger

Installs a timer which plays Eye of the Tiger every x seconds
Ment to be installed if a user leaves a workstation unlocked. (Ment to teach users a lesson about allways locking your workstation before leaving it)
Also opens up a bunch of windows at first in case they come back early and starts screensaver and kills explorer.exe.

On less powerfull machines it could cause a potential crash or a hard slow down, just on the fact on how many windows are open at once.
